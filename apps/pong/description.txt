	<p class="lead">What just happened?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>In the <code>apps</code> folder, we loaded <code>main.js</code>, the default initiator for an app. This told us what files the apps needs...</li>
		<li>Two text files were loaded:
			<ul>
				<li>One for this block of text.</li>
				<li>One for the markup of the pong game.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The stylesheet for the pong game was loaded.</li>
		<li>The app checked that jQuery was loaded and ready.</li>
		<li>The app checked that TinyGrowl (for popup messages) was loaded, and loaded it if not.</li>
		<li>Main.js ran and loaded the markup for the game into the box while it wired up JavaScript to run the pong game logic.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>To see this code for yourself, look in <code>assets/apps/pong</code>.</p>
